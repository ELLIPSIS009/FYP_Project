  <br>

  <p>Lip reading involves interpreting the movements of a person's lips, tongue, and other facial features to understand their speech. This form of communication is crucial for humans, as we predominantly rely on speaking with one another to convey information.
    Lip reading allows you to “listen” to a speaker by watching the speaker's face to figure out their speech patterns, movements, gestures and expressions. Often called “a third ear,” lip reading goes beyond simply reading the lips of a speaker to decipher individual words.
  </p>

  <p>To understand each other we use many senses, the most important aspect being the voice of the other person. Other than the voice, we also consider the expressions of the person, the movement of the mouth, position of the lips and tongue, the movement of the hands and the body language.
  For each sound, we make a different shape of lips and the tongue and teeth take different positions according to the sound.
  Some of these sounds can have overlapping lip-tongue-teeth position because the sound also depends upon the throat. 
  But still these features can be used to estimate the language being spoken.

    <h3 style="font-size: 2.5rem"> What does this web app do about it ? </h3>
  </center>
  <br>

  <p>Our webapp is an easy to use platform which uses Deep learning model to provide transcript or predict the word being spoken in a video without the use of any sounds.
  <br>
  It provides users with 2 options - upload a video or record live from your camera and we will generate for you, the text transcript in a few seconds.
  </p>

  <p>The model generates frames from the given video, performs face detection by plotting the landmark and extracting the mouth region of interest. 
    These mouth cropped images are then passed as temporal data to a temporal convolution network TCN, which combines the benefits from CNN and RNN. 
  </p>

  <p>The dataset used for training the data set is <a href="https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/lip_reading/lrw1.html">The Oxford-BBC Lip Reading in the Wild (LRW) Dataset </a>
    which contains 500 words or classes with about 1000 videos for each class spoken by hundreds of different speakers
    on the BBC news channels.
